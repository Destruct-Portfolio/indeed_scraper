"[""None""]","[""See description above""]",1.0,Do not care about employees health or wellbeing,Registered nurse,Ticonderoga,NY,"I worked for this company in Ticonderoga NY for three months overnight and have to say this is the most abusive company towards its workers I have ever even heard of let alone had the displeasure of working for. This company literally wrote me up for being in the hospital. You read that correctly. I was sick and in the hospital with a chronic illness I revealed to them in the interview and they hired me fully aware of the severity of my illness which is severe. I was hospitalized with a bout and they wrote me up for ""missing work during your three month probationary period."" I had a second bout a few weeks later and was forced to come in at threat of my job. I could not function and it was a dangerous situation for me. They then threatened me with patient abandonment as I could not perform my duties and they got no one to take my place from their ultra skeleton crew that they had to staff it. They have so little staff they cannot handle any crises or emergencies. I was subsequently fired. The second bout nearly killed me. I almost passed away for real and it took me a month to recover and they terminated me for ""too many absences in the probationary period."" This company literally did not care that I almost died and they contributed to it. This is not exaggerated or overblown. It is a documented fact. They force all workers to make up every single day they miss during their own free time. They schedule you without asking or coordinating it with you. The level of disregard for my health and even my life was astounding and disturbing. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY NO MATTER WHAT BONUSES OR ANYTHING THEY OFFER YOU. YOU WILL REGRET IT AND YOUR LIFE COULD BE IN JEOPARDY AS WELL AS YOUR CAREER. The experience has driven me from the nursing profession permanently. Nursing is not worth losing my life. - less BONUSES OR ANYTHING THEY OFFER YOU. YOU WILL REGRET IT AND YOUR LIFE COULD BE IN JEOPARDY AS WELL AS YOUR CAREER.
