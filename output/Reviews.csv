This company literally wrote me up for being in the hospital. You read that correctly. I was sick and in the hospital with a chronic illness I revealed to them in the interview and they hired me fully aware of the severity of my illness which is severe. I was hospitalized with a bout and they wrote me up for ""missing work during your three month probationary period."" I had a second bout a few weeks later and was forced to come in at threat of my job. I could not function and it was a dangerous situation for me. They then threatened me with patient abandonment as I could not perform my duties and they got no one to take my place from their ultra skeleton crew that they had to staff it. They have so little staff they cannot handle any crises or emergencies. I was subsequently fired. The second bout nearly killed me. I almost passed away for real and it took me a month to recover and they terminated me for ""too many absences in the probationary period."" This company literally did not care that I almost died and they contributed to it. This is not exaggerated or overblown. It is a documented fact. They force all workers to make up every single day they miss during their own free time. They schedule you without asking or coordinating it with you. The level of disregard for my health and even my life was astounding and disturbing. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY NO MATTER WHAT BONUSES OR ANYTHING THEY OFFER YOU. YOU WILL REGRET IT AND YOUR LIFE COULD BE IN JEOPARDY AS WELL AS YOUR CAREER. The experience has driven me from the nursing profession permanently.

I don’t how the other locations are but the one I work for is absolutely terrible. Management will have different rules for different people. They will take away your bonuses for the entire week if you call out. A coworker of mine had $600 in bonuses and had to call off for a family emergency and lost all of it. There bonuses are a joke too, $75 for a full shift, then they wonder why we’re so short staffed. And most of the time you’ll be walking into a complete mess. Some nights I’m by myself as an aide for 40 residents. They do not care about you and will replace you in a heartbeat. Everyone I know that was done dirty by this place and left is doing way better than they ever were with Elderwood.",1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0

[],[],2.0,Please don't put your parents/family here,Environmental Services,Hornell,NY,"I've only worked here for about 4 months and right now I can tell you to NOT bring you family here. We are so short staffed residents get IUDs due to lack of bathroom trips and rarely get the regular care and attention they need. I'm not even a nurse and I had to be the one to clip a residents unkempt nails because nobody else would. People are constantly waiting on showers, haircuts, and other hygienic maintaince due to the staffing issue. (Both bad employees and a lack of general staff) Residents also hardly get the memory care and physical therapy they need, and the food is no better than even the poorest school lunches. At $500+ day to live here, and getting more overcharged on top of that.
The current head nurse is a complete bully to their coworkers for no real reason and is soon to be put in a higher position than they are now.

Bad things aside, the job is not that hard. So long as you keep everything as tidy as you can, it's extremely easy just to do minor upkeep each day. If you like social interaction, the residents are very sweet and will be happy to carry on conversation while you work. Most residents may even be out of their rooms for the day and it makes it easier to get in and get the job done.

TLDR, very drama-filled and cliquey, but we are looking for people who are willing to do their job and do it well/correctly, for the betterment of quality of life for the seniors of our community.",2.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0
