This company literally wrote me up for being in the hospital. You read that correctly. I was sick and in the hospital with a chronic illness I revealed to them in the interview and they hired me fully aware of the severity of my illness which is severe. I was hospitalized with a bout and they wrote me up for ""missing work during your three month probationary period."" I had a second bout a few weeks later and was forced to come in at threat of my job. I could not function and it was a dangerous situation for me. They then threatened me with patient abandonment as I could not perform my duties and they got no one to take my place from their ultra skeleton crew that they had to staff it. They have so little staff they cannot handle any crises or emergencies. I was subsequently fired. The second bout nearly killed me. I almost passed away for real and it took me a month to recover and they terminated me for ""too many absences in the probationary period."" This company literally did not care that I almost died and they contributed to it. This is not exaggerated or overblown. It is a documented fact. They force all workers to make up every single day they miss during their own free time. They schedule you without asking or coordinating it with you. The level of disregard for my health and even my life was astounding and disturbing. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY NO MATTER WHAT BONUSES OR ANYTHING THEY OFFER YOU.

I was hospitalized with a bout and they wrote me up for ""missing work during your three month probationary period."" I had a second bout a few weeks later and was forced to come in at threat of my job. I could not function and it was a dangerous situation for me. They then threatened me with patient abandonment as I could not perform my duties and they got no one to take my place from their ultra skeleton crew that they had to staff it. They have so little staff they cannot handle any crises or emergencies. I was subsequently fired. The second bout nearly killed me. I almost passed away for real and it took me a month to recover and they terminated me for ""too many absences in the probationary period.""

I was hospitalized with a bout and they wrote me up for ""missing work during your three month probationary period."" I had a second bout a few weeks later and was forced to come in at threat of my job. I could not function and it was a dangerous situation for me. They then threatened me with patient abandonment as I could not perform my duties and they got no one to take my place from their ultra skeleton crew that they had to staff it. They have so little staff they cannot handle any crises or emergencies. I was subsequently fired. The second bout nearly killed me. I almost passed away for real and it took me a month to recover and they terminated me for ""too many absences in the probationary period.""

As an agency nurse, I had seen many nursing homes and can compare. Unfortunately the Elderwood overwhelms the night nurses with paperwork, which may jeopardize the patient care. The managers of the facility are good people and good nurses, but they are not ones who make all decisions. I think the upper management has too little understanding of the nursing job. Much of the paperwork we do can be computerized, so we wouldn't have to spend so much time writing manually. In addition, the workplace culture isn't the best. There's a plenty of gossiping and talking behind people's backs going on. I can remember facilities where I wouldn't sit for a minute because of the residents and patients needs.

It was difficult at first, but I learned a lot. I came to love the job. I took another job within the company as a post acute nurse. The reason I decided to change was because the new job had no on call. This new position involved training in an out patient clinic. The difference between acute and out patient dialysis is very wide. In the acute setting I was a respected member of a healtcare team. In the out patient setting I became a punching bag for the dialysis techs. I followed the chain of command to voice my concerns with management, but was met with indifference. I knew this new position was not a good fit and decided to leave the company because they had no acute dialysis positions available. With that said, I believe this is a good company to work for as a nurse. However, there is a difference in which side of the company you work for.
